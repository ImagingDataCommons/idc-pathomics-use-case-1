        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use the [Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/) and [Google Cloud Computing (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com) platforms for pathomics research:\n",
        "\n",
        "* how to select, access, and download cohorts from the IDC;\n",
        "* how to access and process slide microscopy images in DICOM format;\n",
        "* how to run an end-to-end analysis pipeline and visualize the final results exploiting the IDC platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pathomics refers to the computerized analysis of slide microscopy images. Besides radiology, slide microscopy is the second major imaging modality in the IDC. Slide microscopy images show thin sections of tissue samples (e.g., from a resected tumor) at microscopic resolution. They provide a unique glimpse into cellular architecture and function that is essential for diagnosing complex diseases like cancer. Computerized analysis makes the assessment of slide microscopy images more reproducible and less time consuming and it enables the extration of novel digital biomarkers from tissue images.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial builds on the publication \"Classification and mutation prediction from nonâ€“small cell lung cancer histopathology images using deep learning\" ([Coudray et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0177-5)), one of the most cited pathomics publications in recent years. A central use case from this publication is replicated on the CPTAC-LUAD and CPTAC-LSCC data sets in the IDC: the AI-based classification of lung tissue regions into <font color='green'>normal</font>, adenocarcinoma (<font color='red'>LUAD</font>), and squamous cell carcinoma (<font color='blue'>LSCC</font>) tissue. Your own tissue classification use cases can be solved in a similar manner.\n",
        "  \n",
        "To be quickly and freely accessible to everyone, this tutorial was deliberately kept simple and designed to be runnable in Google Colab. It highlights only a small part of what the IDC can offer in terms of data exploration and imaging analysis. More complex use cases can be implemented using GCP virtual machines. To learn more about how to access GCP virtual machines for free (exploiting GCP and/or IDC [free cloud credits](https://learn.canceridc.dev/introduction/requesting-gcp-cloud-credits)) and about the IDC platform, please visit the [IDC user guide](https://learn.canceridc.dev/).\n",
